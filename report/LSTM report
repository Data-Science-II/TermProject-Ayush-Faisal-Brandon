	\subsection{LSTM}
	
	LSTM uses silimar shaped data as GRU, and maintains a control flow similar as an RNN. LSTM processes the data continuously as it grows 
	forward, while the data analyst is allowed to keep or forget the previous code. The analyst may choose to use the previous data through
	operations that can allow the LSTM to keep or forget information as an instruction.

	\subsection{Results}

	The LSTM gives us an accurate prediction that is slightly better than others. The R-Squared is the
	highest given of all three models (not including the autoregression). While the GRU model tended to
	underestimate, or rather undershoot the actual, the LSTM actually overshot it. The LSTM predicted
	higher numbers than the GRU, however both could not account for the dip in the housing market that 
	we believe was caused by the coronavirus pandemic. This is a reasonable assumption since these models
	cannot predict real world issues and events, only how a model should perform under the same previous
	circumstances. The lag plot given was also similar to the GRU, and gave farely accurate measurements
	as well.
